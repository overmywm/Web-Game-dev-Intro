		My name is William Overmyer, I am in the software development track of the IT program here at UC.
		I live here in Cincinnati, about fifteen minutes away over in the College Hill area, lived here
		all my life. I do enjoy me some video games, recently I have been playing:

					</a>
				</td>
				<td>Warframe: an MMO third person shooter set in a fantasy Sci-fi universe where you play as a variety of robots with strange powers...sort of. Story is interesting, gameplay is the big draw, needs a better new player experience. One of my favorites.</td>

					</a>
				</td>
				<td>Remnant from Ashes: another third person shooter, but this time it's trying to be like Dark Souls. It kinda suceeds and hopefully wells well enough to get more content that has been promised. It has three-player co-op so me and my friends are getting our money's worth out of it.</td>

					</a>
				</td>
				<td>Tearaway for the Playstation Vita: it's a cutesy platformer that attempts to use all the special functions and features of the playstation vita, and kind of does. Not worth buying a vita for it but worth a look if you have one this is an interesting look at what the system could do if you used as many of its gimmicks as possible.</td>
